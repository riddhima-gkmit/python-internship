# Learning Vault

This repository is my personal learning vault — a central place where I document concepts, commands, notes, summaries, and best practices across python technology, tools, and topics I explore.

The goal is simple:  
Create a single, organized, and searchable reference for everything I learn over time.

## What This Repository Contains

This repo covers multiple technical topics, including but not limited to:

- System setup and development environment tooling  
- Git workflows and version control best practices  
- Programming fundamentals and language-specific notes  
- Backend frameworks (Django, FastAPI, etc.)  
- Database design and schema strategies  
- Design patterns and architectural principles  
- Coding standards and style guides  
- API design and REST fundamentals  
- Testing, debugging, and performance optimization  
- Deployment, servers, and DevOps basics  

Important:  
Not every topic is complete, and not every topic will be covered to the same depth.  
This repository grows organically as I learn.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each dedicated to a specific topic or technology.  
Each folder may include:

- Notes  
- Cheat sheets  
- Commands  
- Examples  
- Diagrams  
- Best practices  
- Useful references  

The structure evolves continuously — new topics may be added, old ones reorganized, and some sections expanded over time.

## Purpose

This repository helps me:

- Build a consistent learning habit  
- Keep all my knowledge in one place  
- Revisit and revise concepts quickly  
- Track my progress across different domains  
- Create a personal knowledge base I can rely on  

If this repository helps others as well, that is a bonus.

## Philosophy

- Learn → Document → Refine  
- Keep it simple, clear, and useful  
- Prefer practical understanding over theory  
- Improve structure as I grow  
- No pressure to “finish” — learning is continuous

## Final Note

This repository is a living document.  
It changes as I change.  
It grows as I grow.
